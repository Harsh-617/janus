## Step 1 — config.py
**Date**: 2026-05-20
**Files created**: `backend/config.py`
**What was built**:
Central Settings class using pydantic-settings. All environment variables
loaded from backend/.env. Singleton `settings` instance exported for use
across the entire backend.

**Key decisions**:
- Used pydantic-settings over raw os.environ for type safety and validation
- Two Gemini model slots (fast + judge) so we can swap models independently
- JANUS_LOOP_INTERVAL_CYCLES controls how often the self-correction engine fires

**Notes for team**:
- Dev B: when you import settings in your files, use `from config import settings`
- The .env file must be present at backend/.env for the server to start
